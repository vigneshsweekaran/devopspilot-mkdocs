# Explanation:
# While 'mkdocs' and 'mkdocs-material' are the core dependencies, the other packages listed here are
# essential for the functionality you've configured in your mkdocs.yaml file.
#
# - pymdownx.*: These are Markdown extensions that add extra features like mathematical expressions,
#   tables, and other formatting options.  If these are not installed, your MkDocs build might
#   fail or not render correctly if your Markdown files use these features.
#
# So, to ensure your MkDocs site builds correctly with all the features you've specified,
# it's important to include all the packages from the Canvas in your requirements.txt.
#
# You *could* have a minimal requirements.txt with just 'mkdocs' and 'mkdocs-material' and then
# install the other packages separately, but including them all in requirements.txt ensures
# a consistent and reproducible setup.
